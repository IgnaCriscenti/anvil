# Anvil DBM — Specification v1

## 1. Vision

Anvil is a free (FOSS), cross-platform desktop database manager written in Go with
[go-gui](https://github.com/go-gui-org/go-gui). It is aimed at technical users in general:
connect to a database, explore its tables, run SQL and edit data safely.

| Aspect      | Decision                                   |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Users       | General FOSS audience (technical users)    |
| Platforms   | Linux (X11/Wayland), Windows, macOS        |
| Engines     | SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL / MariaDB, SQL Server, Oracle 12c+ |

### 1.1 v1 scope

Included:
- Connection management (create, edit, delete, test, connect/disconnect).
- Simple list of tables and views per connection, with a refresh button per connection and database.
- Tabs in the central area: tables and SQL editors, from any connection (§4.1).
- Creating tables (with a form) and databases (§3.5).
- SQL editor with highlighting, autocompletion and history.
- Paginated results grid.
- Data editing in the grid, with pending changes and a transaction.
- Export of results to CSV/JSON.
- Light/dark theme.

Out of scope for v1:
- Full schema explorer (indexes, triggers, altering or dropping objects). Foreign keys are only read to navigate between rows (§6.5).
- SSH tunnel and connection folders/groups.
- Specialized JSON/JSONB editor (shown and edited as text).
- i18n (the UI stays in English) and configurable shortcuts.
- Editing the results of arbitrary queries.

```

### 2.1 Local persistence

- SQLite at `os.UserConfigDir()/anvil/anvil.db` (for example `~/.config/anvil/anvil.db`), accessed with GORM.
- **Pure Go** SQLite driver (`glebarez/sqlite` for GORM, which uses `glebarez/go-sqlite`, a fork of
  `modernc.org/sqlite`) to build without CGO on the 3 platforms. The same driver (`glebarez/go-sqlite`, name
  `"sqlite"`) is used for the user's SQLite connections. **Do not** import `modernc.org/sqlite` directly:
  both register `"sqlite"` and the program panics on startup.
- `AutoMigrate` on startup, with the models from §3 and §6.3.

### 2.2 Access to the user's databases

- GORM is used **only** for the local configuration. The user's databases are queried with `database/sql`,
  because columns and types are dynamic.
- Drivers (all pure Go): `jackc/pgx/v5/stdlib`, `go-sql-driver/mysql`, `glebarez/go-sqlite`,
  `microsoft/go-mssqldb`, `sijms/go-ora/v2`.
- The user's SQLite databases are opened with a `file:` URI (`mode=rw`, or `mode=ro` if read-only), so
  no empty file is created if the path does not exist.
- `Driver` interface per engine:
  - `Open(ctx, DBConn, password) (*sql.DB, error)`
  - `ListDatabases(ctx) ([]string, error)` and `MaintenanceDB() string`: for connections without a database (§3.4).
  - `ListTables(ctx) ([]Table, error)`: tables and views.
  - `Columns(ctx, table) ([]Column, error)`: name, type, nullable, whether it is a PK, whether it is identity/autoincrement.
  - `ForeignKeys(ctx, table) ([]ForeignKey, error)`: name, columns, referenced table and columns (in order).
  - `QuoteIdent(string) string`: `"x"` in PG/SQLite/Oracle, `` `x` `` in MySQL, `[x]` in SQL Server.
  - `Placeholder(n int) string`: `$n` in PG, `?` in MySQL/SQLite, `@pN` in SQL Server, `:N` in Oracle.
  - `SplitStatements(sql string) []Span`: respects strings, comments, `$$` (PG), `DELIMITER` (MySQL),
    `GO` batches and routine bodies (SQL Server), `/` after PL/SQL blocks and `q'[…]'` strings (Oracle).
  - `Analyze(stmt string) Statement`: kind of statement (read/write, DML, `WHERE`, transaction control) for
    the safeguards (§8).
  - `AutoIncrement(type) (def, inlinePK)` and `CreateDatabase(name) string`: the DDL dialect (§3.5).
  - `Limit(orderBy, limit, offset) string`: `LIMIT … OFFSET …` in PG/MySQL/SQLite, `OFFSET … ROWS FETCH
    NEXT … ROWS ONLY` in SQL Server (which adds `ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)` if there is no order) and Oracle.
  - `InsertDefaults(table, cols) string`: the `INSERT` of a row with only defaults (`DEFAULT VALUES`,
    `() VALUES ()` in MySQL, `(first column) VALUES (DEFAULT)` in Oracle).
- MySQL connections use `ClientFoundRows` so that `RowsAffected` counts the rows found, not only the changed
  ones (§7.3).

## 3. Connection management

### 3.1 `DBConn` model

| Field        | Type     | Notes                                                       |
|--------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gorm.Model` |          | ID, timestamps, soft delete                                 |
| `Name`       | string   | Visible alias, required                                     |
| `Color`      | string   | Hex (`#RRGGBB`) for the indicator in the sidebar            |
| `Engine`     | string   | `sqlite` \| `postgres` \| `mysql` \| `mssql` \| `oracle`     |
| `Host`       | string   | Not applicable to SQLite                                    |
| `Port`       | int      | Defaults to 5432 / 3306 / 1433 / 1521                       |
| `User`       | string   | Not applicable to SQLite                                    |
| `DB`         | string   | Database name; for SQLite it is the file path, for Oracle the service name (required). Empty in PG/MySQL/SQL Server = all databases (§3.4) |
| `ReadOnly`   | bool     | Blocks writes (§7)                                          |
| `SSLMode`    | string   | PG: `disable/require/verify-ca/verify-full`; MySQL: `false/true/skip-verify/custom`; SQL Server: `false/true/trust/strict/disable`; Oracle: `disable/require/verify` |
| `SSLCA`      | string   | Path to the CA                                              |
| `SSLCert`    | string   | Path to the client certificate                              |
| `SSLKey`     | string   | Path to the client key                                      |
| `SavePassword` | bool   | If false, the password is asked for on connect              |

### 3.2 Passwords

- Stored in the OS keyring (service `ANVIL-DBM`, key = `strconv.FormatUint(ID, 10)`).
- If the keyring is not available (for example Linux without Secret Service): **it is not persisted**.
  `SavePassword=false` is set and the password is asked for on every connection. The user is warned once.
- Deleting a connection also deletes its keyring entry.
- The password stays in memory only while the connection is open.

### 3.3 Operations

- **Create and edit**: modal with the fields for the engine (SQLite shows a file picker instead of
  host/port/user). **Test connection** button (Open + Ping with a 10 s timeout).
- **Delete**: confirmation, then deletion of the record and the keyring entry.
- **Connect/disconnect**: from the sidebar. One `*sql.DB` is kept per open connection.

### 3.4 Connection without a database (all databases)

- If the `DB` field is left empty in PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQL Server, the connection shows **every database
  on the server** the user can access, and each database expands to show its tables.
  - PG: `pg_database` without templates, with `datallowconn` and the `CONNECT` privilege. The main connection
    goes to the `postgres` maintenance database (without a database, libpq would use one named after the user).
  - MySQL: `information_schema.SCHEMATA`, hiding `information_schema`, `performance_schema`, `mysql` and `sys`.
  - SQL Server: `sys.databases` without the system ones, online and with `HAS_DBACCESS`. The main connection
    goes to `master`.
  - Oracle has no list: the service is the database and the tables are those of the session's schema.
- Each database is opened in its own pool the first time it is expanded (`Session.Pool`), with the password
  that stays in memory while the connection is open. Every pool is closed on disconnect.

### 3.5 Creating tables and databases

- **New table**: a `+` button next to the table filter of each database opens a dialog with the table name
  and its columns (name, type, Nullable, PK, Auto inc., default). It is disabled on read-only connections.
  The dialog shows the `CREATE TABLE` that will run, built live; Create stays disabled while the definition
  is invalid and the reason is shown instead of the SQL. Name and type have a fixed width so the rows line
  up; past a few columns the list scrolls inside the dialog instead of growing it.
  - Names are quoted with `QuoteIdent`. Types are typed by the user and must be a type name with optional
    arguments (`integer`, `varchar(255)`, `numeric(10, 2)`, `timestamp with time zone`, `text[]`). Defaults
    are an SQL expression (`'abc'`, `0`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`) and cannot end the statement.
  - PK columns are `NOT NULL` and the PK is a table constraint. Auto increment needs the column to be the
    only PK column and have no default: PG and Oracle `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY`, MySQL
    `AUTO_INCREMENT`, SQL Server `IDENTITY(1,1)`, SQLite `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` (the declared
    type is replaced). `DEFAULT` goes before `NOT NULL` (Oracle requires that order).
  - In PG the table goes to the first schema of the `search_path` (usually `public`). After creating it,
    the database's table list is reloaded and the new table opens. Errors stay in the dialog.
- **New database** (PG, MySQL and SQL Server): a **New database** button at the top of the database list of a connection
  without a database (§3.4) asks for the name and runs `CREATE DATABASE` on the main pool. The list is
  reloaded and the new database expands. Disabled on read-only connections.
- **New SQLite file**: the connection form has **New…** next to Browse…, which picks a path with the save
  dialog and creates an empty database file there. An existing file is never overwritten: it is used as is.

└──────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 status bar
```

- **Top bar**: global actions (add, edit and delete connections, connect/disconnect, theme).
- **Sidebar**: connections with their color dot. Expanding an open connection shows a flat list of
  tables and views, with a text filter and the New table button (§3.5). If the connection has no database
  (§3.4), the databases are listed first, after a New database button, and each one expands into its table
  list and its filter. The engine is shown at the right end of the connection row.
- **Refresh**: an open connection has a refresh button (`⟳`) at the end of its row. With a database configured
  it reloads the table list; without one (§3.4) it reloads the database list and the tables of every database
  already loaded (a database that is gone is dropped from the tree). Each loaded database has its own refresh
  button that reloads its tables. The button is disabled while that list is loading; open tabs are not
  touched. The sidebar only scrolls
  vertically: a name longer than the row is clipped, so it never widens the tree or hides the buttons.
- **Central area**: a tab bar (§4.1) above the active tab. A table tab shows the table with two views:
  - **Structure**: columns with type, nullable, PK/autoincrement and FK.
  - **Data**: paginated grid of the table (§6), with foreign key navigation (§6.5) and editing (§7) through
    the bar below the grid.
  A new table tab starts on the last view chosen. A table opened by following a FK has a back button
  (`‹`) next to its name.
- **Status bar**: active connection (the active tab's), query status, time, rows, pagination.
- **Dialogs** never grow past their width or the window: user values in titles (connection or column names)
  are cut with `…`, messages wrap and long lists scroll inside the dialog. A UI test opens every dialog with
  long values and fails if anything sticks out (`TestNoOverflow`).

### 4.1 Tabs

- A tab is an open **table** (with its Structure / Data views and its FK chain, §6.5) or an **SQL
  editor**. Tabs from different connections and databases live in the same bar: each one shows the color dot
  of its connection, an icon (table, view or SQL), its title (the table, schema-qualified like the sidebar,
  or `SQL · <database>`) and a close button (`×`). The bar scrolls horizontally when the tabs do not fit.
- **Preview tab**: a click on a table in the sidebar activates its tab if it is already open (a tab showing that
  table without a FK filter); otherwise it opens it in the **preview** tab (title in italics), which the next
  table opened from the sidebar replaces. A double click on the table or on the tab, following a foreign key
  or having pending changes makes it permanent. A table created with New table (§3.5) opens in a permanent tab.
- **SQL tabs**: the `<>` button at the end of the bar (or Ctrl+T) opens an SQL editor on the active tab's database
  (or the selected connection's, if it has its database configured). Each SQL tab has its own text and result.
  SQL is only written in SQL tabs: table tabs have no SQL view.
- **Pending changes stay in their tab**: switching tabs does not ask (the cell being edited is committed first;
  if its value is invalid, the switch does not happen). A tab with unsaved changes shows `•` after its title.
  Closing it asks first (§7.2).
- Closing the active tab activates its neighbor (the next one, or the previous one if it was the last).
  Disconnecting or deleting a connection asks for each of its tabs with pending changes and then closes all of
  its tabs.
- **Shortcuts** (global: they work with the focus in the editor or the grid, not while a dialog is open):
  Ctrl+W closes the active tab, Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab move to the next / previous tab, Ctrl+T opens an
  SQL tab.
- Open tabs are not restored when Anvil starts again (left for later).

---

## 5. SQL editor

### 5.1 Features

- The SQL editor lives in SQL tabs (§4.1): any number of them per database, each with its own text and result.
- Editor: `github.com/go-gui-org/go-edit` (pure Go; selection, undo, line numbers).
- **Syntax highlighting** with `chroma` through go-edit (lexer by engine: `postgresql`, `mysql`, `tsql`, `sql`;
  `github-dark` / `github` style depending on the theme).
- **Autocompletion**: dialect keywords, table and column names of the active connection
  (cached on connect, with manual refresh).
- **History** per connection, persisted locally (§6.3), with search and the option to load a query back
  into the editor.

### 5.2 Execution

- `Ctrl+Enter` runs the **selection**; if there is no selection, it runs the **statement under the cursor**
  (determined with `SplitStatements`).
- **Several statements** in the selection: they run in order, in the same session.
  - If several return rows (for example 2 SELECTs), only the **last** result is shown. The status bar
    keeps the summary of each statement (rows or affected rows, and duration).
  - If any statement is an `UPDATE`/`DELETE` (or `INSERT`) and is not inside an explicit transaction
    (`BEGIN … COMMIT/ROLLBACK`), a **warning** is shown before running ("modifies data without a
    transaction") and the user chooses whether to continue or cancel.
  - If a statement fails, execution stops and the app reports which one failed and which statements had
    already run.
- Execution is **asynchronous**: it runs in a goroutine with a `context.WithCancel`. The UI does not block and
  the **Stop** button cancels the query (cancels the context; in PG it sends the driver's cancel request).
- If the statement returns rows, they are shown in the results grid (**read-only**, §6.4). Otherwise,
  the affected rows and the duration are shown.
- Errors are shown with `appErrors` (title and description, plus the engine message).

---

## 6. Grid and pagination

### 6.1 Page size

- Selectable between **20 and 500** rows (100 by default). Remembered per tab.

### 6.2 Pagination strategy

- **Keyset** if the table has a single PK with identity/autoincrement (or a single sortable PK):
  `SELECT … WHERE pk > :last ORDER BY pk LIMIT :n` (and `<` with `ORDER BY pk DESC` to go back).
- **OFFSET** in every other case: `SELECT … ORDER BY <pk or nothing> LIMIT :n OFFSET :k`.
- SQL editor results are paginated by wrapping the user's query:
  `SELECT * FROM (<query>) AS q LIMIT :n OFFSET :k`. This only applies to SELECT/WITH statements; everything
  else runs as is.
- The total row count (`COUNT(*)`) is computed on demand (button), not on every page.

### 6.3 Additional local models

- `QueryHistory { gorm.Model; ConnID uint; SQL string; Duration int64; RowsAffected int64; Error string }`.
- `Settings { Theme string; DefaultPageSize int }` (single row).

### 6.4 Data types

| Type               | Display                               | Editing                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Text / numbers     | As is                                 | Inline text input           |
| Date / time / timestamp | ISO 8601 (`2006-01-02 15:04:05[.000] ±07:00`) | Dialog with a calendar (dates) and an `HH:MM:SS` field (times), or **Set Now**; never typed text |
| BLOB / bytea       | `<BLOB 1.2 KB>` + first bytes in hex  | **Read-only**               |
| JSON / JSONB       | Text                                  | Inline text input           |
| NULL               | Dimmed `NULL`, distinct from `''`     | **Set NULL** (`Ctrl+0` in the input) if the column is nullable |

The grids (Structure, Data and SQL results) draw every border, inner and outer, and the header row has a
background different from the data rows. The Data grid starts with a `#` column that numbers the rows shown
from 1. Cells show only the first line of the value, cut at 30 characters
and ending in `…` if something was trimmed. Columns that do not fit in the panel width are reachable with
horizontal scroll (scrollbar or Shift+wheel).

### 6.5 Foreign key navigation

- When a table is opened its foreign keys are read along with its columns (not for views). The Structure tab
  shows them in the Key column (`FK → table.column`).
- In the Data tab, every non-NULL cell of a foreign key column has a link button after the value. It opens the
  referenced table in the Data tab, filtered by `refcol = value` (every column of a composite FK); the
  filter is shown in the toolbar and applies to pagination and `COUNT(*)`.
- A table opened this way has a back button in its header that returns to the previous table with its page
  as it was. Opening a table from the sidebar starts over.
- SQL editor results have no links (their columns are not tied to a table).

---

## 7. Grid data editing

### 7.1 Where editing is allowed

- Only in the **Data tab** of a table, opened from the sidebar or by following a foreign key (§6.5). SQL
  editor results are **never** editable.
- If the connection is marked `ReadOnly`, the grid is read-only.
- Views are read-only. BLOB columns are read-only.

### 7.2 Pending changes

- Every edit, insertion or row deletion stays **pending** until it is saved. Modified cells are highlighted,
  new rows go on top of the grid marked `+` (unset columns show `DEFAULT`) and deleted rows are struck
  through (their `#` number too).
- Pending changes refer to the rows of the current page.
- **Save (N)** opens a preview of the SQL that will run (with the values inlined, only to show them) and, on
  confirmation, applies everything in **one transaction**, in the order the changes were made. If a
  statement fails, everything is rolled back, the error is shown in the preview naming the change
  (for example "The DELETE of row 1 failed: …") and the changes stay pending so they can be fixed.
- **Cancel** discards every pending change.
- Changing page, refreshing, changing the page size, going back, closing the tab, disconnecting or
  deleting the connection with pending changes asks first: **Save…**, **Discard** or **Cancel**. Opening
  another table or switching tabs does not: the changes stay in their tab (§4.1).
- Closing the window with unsaved changes (including a cell being edited) asks to **Keep editing** or
  **Discard and close**.

### 7.3 Row identification

- **With a PK**: `UPDATE/DELETE … WHERE pk1 = ? [AND pk2 = ?]` with the original values.
- **Without a PK**: the `WHERE` uses **every comparable column** with its original values (`col IS NULL`
  for NULLs; binary, JSON, XML, geometric and floating point columns are excluded). A warning is shown
  before the first change to an existing row.
- **Single-row guarantee**: after each `UPDATE`/`DELETE`, `RowsAffected == 1` is checked. If it is any
  other number, the **whole transaction is rolled back** and the offending row is reported
  (for example "would affect 3 identical rows", or "found no row" if it was changed or deleted meanwhile).

### 7.4 DML generation

- Always with parameters (`Placeholder`) and table and column names with `QuoteIdent`; values are never
  concatenated. Values are sent as text (NULL as `nil`) and the engine converts them to the column type.
- `INSERT` only lists the columns the user set, omitting identity/autoincrement columns left empty; with no
  columns it inserts the defaults.
- MySQL does not accept the offset the grid shows in dates (`… +00:00`): dates are sent in UTC without it.
  MySQL `BOOL` is `TINYINT` (0/1).
- SQL Server and Oracle get dates as `time.Time` (Oracle would parse text with `NLS_DATE_FORMAT`). An
  Oracle `DATE` also has a time of day: the grid shows it unless it is midnight.

### 7.5 Editing in the Data tab

- **Selection**: clicking a cell selects its row and opens the cell's editor. Ctrl+click (Cmd on macOS) adds
  or removes rows and Shift+click selects a range from the last row picked, without editing. Clicking a `#`
  number selects the row without editing. Selected rows have their number filled with the accent color and a
  tinted background; the clicked cell is underlined.
- **Editors**: text and numbers use an inline input: Enter or leaving the cell keeps the value, Esc
  discards it, `Ctrl+0` sets NULL. **Dates and times never ask for text**: a dialog with a calendar (dates)
  and an `HH:MM:SS` field (times) opens on the cell's value, with **Now**, **Set NULL** (if nullable),
  **Cancel** and **OK**. The offset is kept for `with time zone` types.
- **Bar below the grid**:

  | Group | Buttons | Acts on |
  |-------|---------|---------|
  | Changes | **Save (N)**, **Cancel** | Every pending change |
  | Rows | **Add**, **Delete (N)** / **Restore** | Add: a new row on top, editing its first column. Delete: the selected rows (new rows are removed); Restore when all of them are already deleted |
  | Values | **Set NULL**, **Set Now** | The column of the clicked cell in every selected row (or the cell being edited). Set NULL only for nullable columns; Set Now only for date/time columns |

  On the right, the bar shows how many rows are selected and a summary of the pending changes.

---

## 8. Safeguards

- **Read-only connection**: besides disabling grid editing, the SQL editor rejects statements that are not
  reads (`SELECT`, `WITH` without DML, `SHOW`, `EXPLAIN`, read `PRAGMA`s).
  In PG the session is also opened with `default_transaction_read_only = on`; in MySQL with
  `SET SESSION TRANSACTION READ ONLY`. SQL Server and Oracle have no read-only sessions: only anvil's checks
  apply (SQL Server connections declare `ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly`).
- **DELETE/UPDATE without WHERE**: when the SQL editor detects an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` without `WHERE`, it asks
  for explicit confirmation before running it.

---

## 9. Export

- From any grid: **CSV** (RFC 4180, UTF-8, with headers) or **JSON** (array of objects).
- Scope: the current page or the full result (re-run in streaming, without loading everything into
  memory).
- NULL: empty cell in CSV and `null` in JSON. BLOB as base64.

---

## 10. Theme

- Light and dark, switchable from the top bar and persisted in `Settings`.
- Icons are own SVGs with `stroke="currentColor"`; they are painted with the active theme's text color
  (`SvgCfg.Color`), so they must be re-rendered when the theme changes.

## 11. Errors

- Every error that reaches the UI is an `*appErrors.AppError` (Title + Description + wrapped Err).
- Add `Unwrap() error` to `AppError` so `errors.Is/As` can be used.
- UI messages stay in English (no i18n in v1).

## 12. Current state and detected debt

The 6 findings from the initial review are resolved (milestone 1):

1. ~~`string(conn.ID)` as the keyring key~~ → `strconv.FormatUint` (`connections.keyringKey`).
2. ~~Connection created even if `keyring.Set` fails~~ → `Save` runs in a transaction and, if the keyring fails,
   saves with `SavePassword=false` and returns `SaveResult.Warning`.
3. ~~`delete.go` does not delete the keyring entry or check rows~~ → looks up the row (not found), deletes it and cleans the keyring.
4. ~~Incomplete message in `password.go`~~ → complete messages and wrapped `err` (`ErrPasswordNotFound`).
5. ~~300×300 window with a red border~~ → 1200×760 window with the §4 layout.
6. ~~Empty `internal/interfaces`~~ → removed.

### 12.1 Progress

- **Milestone 1 (done)**: models, local database, connection service, drivers (SQLite/PG/MySQL with metadata,
  `SplitStatements`, `Analyze`), sessions, settings, UI with top bar, sidebar (connections + tables with
  filter), create/edit modal with Test connection, password prompt, delete with confirmation, persisted
  light/dark theme and structure view of the selected table.
- **Milestone 2 (done)**: Structure / Data / SQL tabs per table, read-only paginated grid (keyset or
  OFFSET, on-demand COUNT, dimmed NULL, summarized BLOB), SQL editor with go-edit: Ctrl+Enter (selection or
  statement under the cursor), several statements with the last result, warnings (no WHERE / no transaction),
  read-only, Stop, results pagination and saving to history (`internal/query`, `internal/history`).
- **Foreign key navigation** in the Data tab (§6.5): link buttons on FK cells, filtered referenced table,
  back button.
- **Milestone 3**: autocompletion, history panel with search, metadata refresh.
- **Milestone 4 (done)**: grid editing (`internal/editing`, §7): pending changes, SQL preview, single
  transaction with the `RowsAffected == 1` check, row identification with or without a PK, multi-row
  selection with the `#` column, bar below the grid (Save, Cancel | Add, Delete | Set NULL, Set Now),
  calendar/time editor for dates, and confirmation before leaving or closing the window with unsaved
  changes.
- **Tabs** (§4.1): table and SQL tabs from any connection, preview tab, pending changes per tab, close guard
  and shortcuts (`ui/tabs.go`). **Refresh** of the table and database lists from the sidebar.
- **Creating tables and databases** (§3.5): `internal/schema`, New table dialog with SQL preview, New
  database for server connections and New… SQLite file in the connection form.
- **Overflow fixes**: dialogs and the sidebar keep long values inside them (§4), checked by `TestNoOverflow`.
- **README** with screenshots of a demo database, regenerated by `TestReadmeScreenshots`
  (`ANVIL_README_SHOTS=docs/screenshots`).
- **Milestone 5**: export, packaging and release. Done so far: `makefile` with per-platform builds and
  GoReleaser on GitHub Actions for `v*` tags (§13). Pending: export, the macOS build (§13) and the packages.

### 12.2 Known dependency limitations

- go-gui v0.92: a vertical `gui.Splitter` inside another `gui.Splitter` doubles the row height of
  `gui.Table`. The SQL tab splits editor/results in a fixed proportion (45 %) instead of using a splitter.
- go-gui v0.92: `datagrid.GridCellFormat` has no public constructor; the grids use `gui.Table`, which supports
  per-cell styling.
- go-gui v0.92: a horizontally scrolling container stores the content width before the table takes its
  final width and clips the scroll to that value. The grid measures its natural width every frame and passes
  it as `MinWidth` (`naturalWidth` in `ui/resultGrid.go`).
- go-gui v0.92: `gui.Table` has no header color; row 0 is painted as selected (`gridStyle`). It has no
  per-row background either: selected rows are shown with the `#` number filled and a text background.
- go-gui v0.92: `gui.Table` measures column widths from `TableCellCfg.Value` even when the cell has
  `Content` (buttons, inputs): the value is padded to make room. `TableCellCfg.ID` is not applied to the cell.
- go-gui v0.92: `gui.DatePicker` only picks days; times use a masked input next to it.
- go-gui v0.92: a single-line `gui.Text` cannot shrink below its measured width, so a long value widens
  every container up to the window. Labels that may be long sit in a `FillFit` row with `Clip`
  (`components.TreeLabel`), as go-gui's Combobox does. The dialog title is a single-line text too: user
  values in it are cut with `components.Ellipsis`. Wrapped text does not break words longer than the line.
- go-gui v0.92: headless UI tests must call `soft.RenderToImage` before checking sizes; without it texts get
  default widths and an overflow goes unnoticed.
- go-edit v0.12: the editor keeps the text measurer of the first software render; a second
  `soft.RenderToImage`/`RenderToPNG` of the same window uses it after it was closed and panics. Only affects
  headless screenshots of the SQL tab: they render once.
- go-edit v0.12: the editor lays out a floating layer that sticks out of its pane, so `TestNoOverflow` does
  not check a window with an SQL tab active.
- go-gui v0.92: there is no click count; double clicks (sidebar table, tab) are detected with the time between
  two clicks on the same widget (`App.doubleClick`, 400 ms).
- go-edit v0.12: `ActionFunc` takes an unexported type; the run action is declared generic
  (`runAction[S any]`) and reads the cursors through reflection.
- When an execution ends with an open transaction (`BEGIN` without `COMMIT`), a `ROLLBACK` is issued and the
  status bar says so: each execution uses its own session.

### 12.3 Review backlog (October 2026)

Findings from a project review at `6d19248`, to take into account in the next versions.

**Possible bugs**

1. **Pagination fallback inside a PG transaction** (`internal/query/exec.go`, `fetch`): if the wrapped
   `SELECT * FROM (…) anvil_q` fails after a `BEGIN` (for example duplicate columns in a `JOIN`), PG aborts the
   transaction and the unwrapped retry fails with "current transaction is aborted". Use a `SAVEPOINT`
   before the wrapped attempt, or do not wrap while a transaction is open.
2. **`returning()` with `strings.Contains`** (`internal/query/exec.go`): a `'returning'` literal or a
   `returning_date` column is taken as `… RETURNING`. Detect it with the tokens of `drivers/lexer.go`.
3. **Implicit transactions in Oracle and SQL Server** (`txOpen`, `internal/query/plan.go`): only
   `BEGIN`/`START` open a transaction. In Oracle any DML opens one without `BEGIN` (and so does SQL Server with
   `SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS ON`). Check what `go-ora` does when that connection goes back to the pool with
   uncommitted DML: a later use could commit it.
4. **macOS release binaries** (`.goreleaser.yaml`): darwin is built with `CGO_ENABLED=0`, which panics on
   startup (§13). Leave darwin out of the release until there is a job on a macOS runner with CGO.

**To add**

- CI on every PR (`go vet`, `go test`), not only on `v*` tags; optionally with PostgreSQL and MySQL services
  and the `ANVIL_TEST_*` variables.
- Export to CSV/JSON (§9) before 1.0.
- SSH tunnel: move it up, ahead of polishing Oracle and SQL Server.
- Configurable query timeout, and a warning when the client-side pagination fallback has to read and
  discard many rows to reach the offset.
- Use the connection `Color` to tint the top bar or the SQL tab, as a signal for production connections.

**To remove or simplify**

- Mark Oracle and SQL Server as *experimental* in the README until CI covers them against real servers; focus
  1.0 on SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL.
- Translate the remaining Spanish comments (`main.go`, `.goreleaser.yaml`) to English.
- Reduce the duplication between §12 and the README feature list: progress lives here, the README stays
  user-facing.

## 13. Distribution and license

- **License**: MIT (`LICENSE` file at the root).
- **Binaries** on GitHub Releases for Linux (amd64/arm64), Windows (amd64/arm64) and macOS (amd64/arm64),
  built by GoReleaser on GitHub Actions when a `v*` tag is pushed (`.goreleaser.yaml`,
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`): tests, `.tar.gz` (`.zip` on Windows) archives with `LICENSE` and
  `README.md`, and `SHA256SUMS`. `-X main.version` stamps the version (`anvil --version`); Windows builds
  use `-H=windowsgui` so no console opens. Tags with a suffix (`v0.5.0-beta`) are pre-releases.
- Linux and Windows build without CGO thanks to the pure Go SQLite (§2.1). **macOS needs CGO**: go-gui's
  Metal backend is Objective-C. A `CGO_ENABLED=0` darwin build compiles but has no backend and panics on
  startup, so macOS binaries must be built on a macOS runner with CGO (pending: the current GoReleaser
  config and `makefile` build darwin with `CGO_ENABLED=0`).
- The `makefile` builds locally: `make build`, `make build-<os>-<arch>`, `make release` (every platform
  plus `SHA256SUMS` in `dist/`).
- **Packages**: AUR (Linux), Homebrew (macOS) and winget (Windows), published from the same release
  pipeline.
